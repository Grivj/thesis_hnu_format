\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this research work, I investigated in many ways the effects of applying
Gaussian noise to normal images and adversarial examples on the prediction of
convolutional neural networks. Motivated by the observed disparities, I
developed a method for detecting adversarial examples based on computing two
scores. Contrary to many other techniques, it does not require prior knowledge
of the attack, with the advantages of being optimization-free and having a low
computation cost.

Moreover, because of the low computation cost and easy implementation, my method
can easily be compounded with other existing defense methods to optimize
detection performances.
